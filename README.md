"Memo" is a personal web app for documenting experiences. I upload photos and audio clips, and the app pieces them together into stories. Right now the stories are very simple and the design is rough. I will keep working on this app in bits and pieces. If I find time to substantially improve the interface, I will open it up to others in the future and expand on this documentation. Feedback and contributions are welcome.
